# Description
- Most people talk vaguely about travel. Many a times they are themselves confused about where they want to travel. They do not know the best time to travel to a specific location, or what other things are available there.
This results in an unplanned and hence a failed trip. Trip planning can be a daunting task and picking a destination is immensely important, as it gives you a definite goal.
- Our project successfully deals with the problem of people being confused/not being able to select the perfect travel destination.
- This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
