	<div class="middle">
	<h2>1. Sonmarg - Paradise Full of Snow</h2>

  <a href="..\book.html">Book your tickets here!</a>
	<p>Glaciers, frozen lakes and snow carpets rolled out till the horizon, Sonamarg, literally translating to 'The Meadow of Gold', is a snow paradise in winters. A popular destination to see snowfall in India for mountain lovers, this place is covered with a beautiful sheet of snow in the peak winters and is a sight to see and experience. </p>
	<p>Since summers hit this area a bit late, in May, you can occasionally find snow in April, while the rest of the country is already playing host to summers. It's also a great place for trekking and river rafting. Thajiwas Glacier is a must visit place if you are going to Sonamarg in the summer season. Snowfall in Kashmir is breathtaking!</p>

	<h2>2. North Sikkim - Perinnial Snow World</h2>
	<img src="Images\sikkim.jpg" width='600px' height='400px'>
  <a href="..\book.html">Book your tickets here!</a>
	<p>Yumthang is known for experiencing snow almost all year round. However, most of the areas here are prone to blockages and being shut down due to heavy snow. So, it's advisable to always and always check and confirm before you plan a trip to this place. </p>
	<p>Also if you are visiting in winter, prepare well to brave the extremely harsh winter conditions. But the spectacular views one gets while in one of the best snow places in India is totally worth the pains. Snow enthusiasts should avoid visiting this place during the monsoon season as the snow starts melting and heavy rains are witnessed.</p>

	<h2>3. Manali & Rohtang Pass - An Essentail!</h2>
	<img src="Images\manali.jpg" width='600px' height='400px'>
  <a href="..\book.html">Book your tickets here!</a>
	<p>Manali is a famous hill station located in the beautiful state of Himachal Pradesh. Surrounded by the towering Himalayan peaks and gorgeous valleys, it's often visited together with the Rohtang Pass. Manali and Rohtang Pass clubbed together are one of the best snow places in India. Solang valley and adventure sports activities such as skiing, mountaineering and trekking are a must while you're in Manali. At Rohtang, blockages and traffic jams are common, so always check before you head out. It's usually closed from January to April, so avoid those months too. Also, definitely avoid visiting these places during the monsoon season.</p>

	<h2>4. Ladakh - The Ultimate Experience</h2>
	<img src="Images\ladakh.jpg" width='600px' height='400px'>
  <a href="..\book.html">Book your tickets here!</a>
	<p>While Leh remains beyond reach for most winters given the harsh conditions, the Chadar Trek is supposed to be an experience like no other and one that every true traveller and trekker has on their list. It's a challenging 9-day trek across the frozen Zanskar river which starts from January in several batches and continues till February, sometimes even March. Several groups and organisations participate in it.</p>
	<p>A warning, though. This trek is not for novices and is meant for trekkers who've had relatively good experience in this arena. That said, Chadar Trek is bound to fascinate you if you want to experience the most amazing snowfall in India. There is also a certain Stok Kangri Trek, as challenging as the Chadar Trek.</p>
