	<p>Goa Carnival, also called "Carnaval", "Intruz", "Entrado", or (colloquially) "Viva Carnival" refers to the festival of carnival, or Mardi Gras, in the Indian State of Goa. Though significantly smaller than the well-known Rio Carnival or the Portuguese Carnival of Madeira, the Goa Carnival is the largest in India and one of the few traditional celebrations of the Catholic holiday in Asia. Despite falling into obscurity during the latter days of the Portuguese colonial rule of Goa, the Goa Carnival was resurrected as a minor street celebration in 1965 and has since turned into a major tourist attraction for the small state.</p>
	<p>A hedonistic traditional feast that commenced in the era of Portuguese settlements in Goa, it paved the way for an elaborate carnival in Goa which is now celebrated with great pomp and show. The festivities do not end with New Year's, but they begin with it for Goa. Parades, dances, bands are an integral part of the celebration along with the customary fearing and drinking. From street to street, Goa lights up like no other city during the carnival days.</p>
	<p>It is mostly celebrated in the month of February.</p>

	<p>Revel in the unending dunes of the Thar desert and yearly Jaisalmer desert festival. It kicks off with a procession from the Jaisalmer Fort where one can witness the locals dress in traditional and bright costumes. Depicting the triumphs and tragedies of the desert, men and women dance in glory and repent. The Gair and the fire dance top off as the prime marvels of the festival. With groups of local nomads Kalabaz or the Nats seen showcasing their gymnastic acts and poignant folk music recitals and ballads being recited in honour of all achievements, the festival marks the true spirit of the desert city. </p>
	<p>The very renowned Pushkar ka Mela is a camel and livestock fair which is over 100 years old now. If you haven't been to the market, you haven't seen anything! Camp stays, hot air balloon rides, camel safaris, traditional competitions like the longest moustache contest or the bridal competition promises unmatched amusement and frolic. Food and beverages unique to Pushkar are, of course offered here. There's some unimaginable fun with a portrayal of the dynamic Rajasthani culture seen at the fete. </p>
