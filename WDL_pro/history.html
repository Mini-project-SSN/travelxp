The Muslim kings also made it their capital, though every Muslim King rehabilitated it at a particular place around the walled city. For example, the present Delhi was founded by Shah Jahan. Red Fort was a grand palace. Delhi of Shah Jahan’s days was founded near Red Fort and Chandni Chowk. Chandni Chowk used to have a beautiful lake during the days of Shah Jahan. During the reign of Qutabudin-Aibak and Altumash, Delhi was situated around Qutab Minar and Mehrauli. When the Lodi dynasty came into power, they made areas near Lodi tombs and Lodi gardens as their official workplaces. The other Muslim kings settled at the places of their own choice. During the days of the Pandavas, Delhi was situated at Old Fort and its periphery.</p>

	<img src="Images\hampi.jpg" width='600px' height='400px'>
  <a href="..\book.html">Book your tickets here!</a>
	<p>Hampi, the city of ruins, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Situated in the shadowed depth of hills and valleys in the state of Karnataka, this place is a historical delight for travellers. Surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, beautiful temples, bustling street markets, bastions, treasury building and captivating remains of Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi is a backpacker's delight. Hampi is an open museum with 100+ locations to explore and a favourite way to see the city from the perspective of its history.</p>
	<p>Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Famous for its massive, beautifully carved temples, especially the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to the patron deity of the empire. You can also find remains of the old aqueducts, canals and military barracks and stables here. Hampi was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986 and many efforts have been taken to restore the lost glory of the place - very limited (if any) modern establishments are allowed in the main area, which gives an authentic feel to the ruins.</p>
